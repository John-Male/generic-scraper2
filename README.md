# generic-scraper2

A configuration-driven web scraper. Describe a site in a spec file; get
structured records out. Built by a SwarmForge four-pack running on Claude Code.

A quick test to see how SwarmForge works to create a generic scraper. The Sonnet 5 model was used for all of the steps. The feature gerkhin files were created from a very brief voice conversation using SuperWhisper. The first 4 phases in the 6 step process ran in less than 2 hours. The hardener process ran for about 1.5 hours and the QA section ran for about 20 minutes. The process runs many local jobs that do not consume tokens.  

Next I will be going to run a similar test using the four-pack with the same model to compare the differences in the outcomes

I am quite impressed with the quality of the code that has been generated so far, I have not attempted to use the code yet

## actual text used to create feature gerkhins in copilot using Think Deeper
```
create gerkin scripts to describe a python generic scraper that will be able to use number of different scraping techniques the main class for the Scraper will be able to receive
